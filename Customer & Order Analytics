--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1)How many orders were placed in January?
--2)How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
--3)Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
--4)Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
--5)What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
--6)Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
--7)How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
